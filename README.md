# BoundedView
A collection of Android bounded views which constraint in boundedWidth/boundedHeight. This library helps to resolve android:maxWidth and layout_width="match_parent" not working together.
Support following views and viewgroups
* BoundedImageView
* BoundedButton
* BoundedTextView
* BoundedImageButton
* BoundedEditText
* BoundedWebView
* BoundedLinearLayout
* BoundedRelativeLayout
* BoundedGridLayout
* BoundedGridView
* BoundedHorizontalScrollView
* BoundedListView
* BoundedScrollView


# Setup
Add as a dependency to your ``build.gradle``:
```groovy
repositories {
    maven {
        url 'https://dl.bintray.com/baole/maven'
    }
}
dependencies {
    compile 'com.anttek.bounded:library:1.0@aar'
}
```

# Usages

Add Boundedxxx to your layout.xml

```
    <com.anttek.boundedview.BoundedLinearLayout
        android:layout_width="match_parent"
        app:boundedHeight="100dp"
        app:boundedWidth="100dp"
        android:layout_height="match_parent"
        android:background="#ffff00"/>
```
Bounded view supports 3 additional attributes that you can define in layout file

* android:boundedWidth
* android:boundedHeight

This library supports for common views included in Android SDK. If you need to implement for others views
such as in support library, using [BoundedViewHelper](https://github.com/baole/BoundedViews/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/anttek/boundedview/BoundedViewHelper.java).
See [BoundedLinearLayout](https://github.com/baole/BoundedViews/blob/master/library/src/main/java/com/anttek/boundedview/BoundedLinearLayout.java) as an example.
